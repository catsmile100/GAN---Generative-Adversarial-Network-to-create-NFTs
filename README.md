# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for NFT Image Generation

This repository contains a simple example of using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images that can potentially be used as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Pillow (PIL)
- Keras (usually included with TensorFlow)

You can install the Python dependencies using pip:

```
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow
```

## Usage

- Download or prepare your NFT dataset and save it as a NumPy array. 
- Replace 'nft_dataset.npy' with your dataset in the code.
- Adjust the GAN model architecture, hyperparameters, and training settings to suit your needs.
- Run the gan_nft_generation.py script to train the GAN and generate images.
```
python gan_nft_generation.py
```
The generated images will be saved in the current directory as generated_image_epoch_X.png, where X is the epoch number.

## About GAN

A GAN is a deep learning architecture consisting of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator learns to generate data, in this case, NFT-like images, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated images. The two networks compete with each other, leading to the creation of more realistic images over time.

## Disclaimer
This is a basic example and is not suitable for generating production-ready NFTs. Real-world NFT generation involves much more complexity and additional considerations related to blockchain integration, copyright, and image quality.

Please make sure to have the appropriate rights for any images you generate and plan to use as NFTs.
